# Malicious-Hangman-Game



This program allows the user to play hangman. The number of guesses and length of the word to be guessed is determined by the user, and they can
only enter numeric values. Then they guess letters, and only single letters are valid inputs The program checks to see if there are words that dont contain the letter the 
user guessed, and if so, those words become the new word bank for the program. This continues until there are no words that don't contain the user's letter guess. If this
happenes, then the program takes a random word as the answer, and the game continues as normal. If the letter shows up in the word, then
it is revealed in the proper spot. If the user runs out of guesses or wins at any point, the game ends. The program asks the user if they want to play again, and if they
do, then the whole game loops again. If not, the program ends.
